However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. DATA RETENTION POLICY

We retain different categories of personal information for varying periods based on the purpose of collection, legal requirements, and legitimate business needs:

**Retention Schedule:**

8. DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference you can set in your browser. When you turn on DNT, your browser sends a signal to websites requesting that they do not track your browsing activity.

Currently, we do not respond to DNT signals. This is because there is no industry-standard interpretation of how to respond to DNT signals. We will update this policy if a standard is established.

Regardless of DNT settings, you can opt out of analytics tracking using the methods described in the Cookies section above.
